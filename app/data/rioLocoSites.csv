1,Sustainable Practices in the Coffee Region,"Sediment pollution caused by poor agricultural practices in the upper RL/GB watershed has been identified as one of the major threats to freshwater and coastal ecosystems. USCRTF members are working in partnership with local NGO&rsquo;s and coffee farmers to address this threat by implement sustainable agricultural practices (i.e., shade-grown coffee) to reduce erosion and sedimentation from the upper watershed, particularly sun coffee plantations. Shade-grown coffee practices also provides many socio-economic benefits and a wide range of conservation values including improving water quality, soil protection, natural pest control, landscape connectivity and habitat to many wildlife species.",shade-slider,../images/slider/shade01.jpg,../images/slider/shade02.jpg,../images/slider/shade03.jpg,../images/slider/shade04.jpg,../images/slider/shade05.jpg,../images/slider/shade06.jpg,18.143,-66.896
2,Erosion and Sediment Control,"Historic land-based activities such as clearing and poor erosion control practices are two of the main factors impacting freshwater resources and coastal ecosystems across the RL/GB watershed. These activities are responsible for increasing sediment transport and deposition to waterways, which cause degradation to water quality, reduce reservoirs storage capacity and impair the recreational and aesthetic value of freshwater and costal resources. Sedimentation also has a detrimental effect on aquatic life and coastal ecosystem ecological functions. Through the RL/GB watershed initiative, agencies and its partners, are focusing their efforts on implementing sustainable corrective actions (e.g., runoff management, riparian forests buffer, and hydroseeding techniques) to address the erosion and sedimentation pollution along the watershed. These actions are aimed to reduce the impact to freshwater and coastal ecosystems, in particular to coral reef. In addition, this effort provide many social benefits by improving water quality and creating opportunities for a wide range of recreational activities such as fishing, kayaking and wildlife photography.",erosion-slider,../images/slider/stream01.jpg,../images/slider/stream02.jpg,../images/slider/erosionControl03.jpg,../images/slider/stream04.jpg,../images/slider/stream05.jpg,../images/slider/stream06.jpg,18.058,-66.886
4,Restoring the Historic Gu&aacute;nica Lagoon,"Gu&aacute;nica lagoon was the largest freshwater wetland system in Puerto Rico and it was drained in 1955 as part of an agricultural development project in the Lajas Valley. Historically, the lagoon provided protection to coastal reefs by acting as natural filter for sediments and other land-based contaminants; and provided a prime habitat for many species of birds and aquatic life in the southwestern part of the island. The loss of Gu&aacute;nica lagoon marked a steady decline of coral reef and caused a major impact to Gu&aacute;nica bay coastal reef ecosystems. Most of historic lagoon footprint is in public domain and it&rsquo;s no longer used for agricultural practices. The USCRTF and its partners are concentrating their efforts to restore the Gu&aacute;nica lagoon historical natural functions and reclaim its value for wildlife and ecological resource.",guanica-slider,../images/slider/guanicaLagoon01.jpg,../images/slider/guanicaLagoon02.jpg,../images/slider/guanicaLagoon03.jpg,../images/slider/guanicaLagoon04.jpg,../images/slider/guanicaLagoon05.jpg,../images/slider/guanicaLagoon06.jpg,17.999,-66.933
5,Treatment Wetlands,"Coastal urban development is recognized as one of the major source of pollution to coastal environments across the Caribbean. Improperly treated sewage and stormwater runoff, for example, are considered two of the major pollutants affecting coral reef and coastal ecosystems of the Gu&aacute;nica bay. These pollutants also represent a major threat to human health and a negative impact to the local economy. As part of RL/GB watershed initiative, the USCRTFA and its partners are working in collaboration to implement a series of &ldquo;treatment wetlands&rdquo; that can act as natural filter for contaminants (i.e. nutrients, bacteria, sediments and heavy metals) coming from treatment plants and runoff urbanize areas. Aside from its ecological value to restore coral reef health, this restoration effort also provide many socio-economic benefits such as improving water quality, minimizing the risk to human health, and opportunities for a wide range of commercial and recreational activities.",wetland-slider,../images/slider/wetland01.jpg,../images/slider/wetland02.jpg,../images/slider/wetland03.jpg,../images/slider/wetland04.jpg,../images/slider/wetland05.jpg,../images/slider/wetland06.jpg,17.966,-66.91
6,Gu&aacute;nica Bay Reefs and Coastal Ecosystems,"Historically, Gu&aacute;nica bay has been associated with some of the most pristine coral reefs and important marine ecosystems on the island. The bay coastal area encompass a broad range of interdependent and complex coastal ecosystems including sandy beaches, salt marshes, estuarine, coral reefs, seagrass beds and mangroves. These ecosystems support a rich biodiversity and provide a wide range of services to the local community such as seafood, shoreline protection, recreation and aesthetics. The goal of the USCRTF and its partners is to restore and preserve these ecological and social values by implementing comprehensive conservation actions and management strategies for improving and protecting the Guánica bay watershed from sources of pollution derived from land use activities and urban development.",coastal-slider,../images/slider/coastal01.jpg,../images/slider/coastal02.jpg,../images/slider/coastal03.jpg,../images/slider/coastal04.jpg,../images/slider/coastal05.jpg,../images/slider/coastal06.jpg,17.949,-66.907
