## The Rio Loco Watershed/ Guánica Bay (RL/GB) Story Map

According to [ESRI](http://storymaps.arcgis.com/en/articles/what-is-a-story-map/):

>Story maps use geography as a means of organizing and presenting information. They tell the story of a place, event, issue, trend, or pattern in a geographic context. They combine interactive maps with other rich content—text, photos, video, and audio—within user experiences that are basic and intuitive.

## The Initiative

The Rio Loco Watershed/ Guánica Bay (RL/GB) initiative began in 2009 as the first U. S. Coral Reef Task Force (USCRTF) Watershed Partnership Initiative. This multiagency effort, led by USDA-NRCS and NOAA, is focused to reduce erosion and sedimentation to coral reefs and costal ecosystems as identified by the RL/GB Watershed Management Plan.

The plan identified six major threats including:

1. Upland erosion in the coffee growing regions
2. Reservoir sedimentation and transport
3. In-stream channel erosion
4. Loss of Historic Guánica Lagoon
5. Legacy contaminants
6. Sewage treatment

Members of the USCRTF and partners are working together to implement restoration actions across the watershed to reduce the threats impacting coral reef ecosystem in the southwestern Puerto Rico.
